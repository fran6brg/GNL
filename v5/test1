[Intro: A$AP Rocky & T.I.]
Gang! Gang
They tryna front on the gang!
They going to remember my name
Ayy, anybody ever took the time to ask Rocky what A$AP mean to him?
Well if so, he'll probably tell you, "Always Striving and Prospering"
A$AP, partna'! Free my nigga, Cap
R.I.P Big Phil, R.I.P A$AP Yams
Ya dig? (Gang!)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
'Cause fuckin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky with Kid Cudi]
I put A$AP on my tat (woo)
I put New York on the map (woo)
I put the gang on the flames (woo)
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains (woo)
I got Goyard by the sack (woo)
I got the boof by the pack (woo)
I fucked your boo on her back

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky with Kid Cudi]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
Hmm

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I'm free as a bird, I wanted this shit my whole life
But had all this stress on my mind
Until I realized, things pan out when it's right
In the meantime I'ma grind
I think of them days when I was so young on my plight
Party and bullshit and play
Was up in the city, the one that's surrounded by lights
Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane, got no time, don't need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter, she's all I need
She got her father, as I grow
Hell yeah, I did it, I'm on a roll
Thought I'd be up with my nigga, no
I'm just gettin' warmed up, let's start the show
I'm schoolin' these niggas, so in the zone and I'm rigged to blow
A$AP and Cud Life forever though
And I'm flossin' and bossin' these silly hoes
Learned the codes, serve up the magic for all of those
Kids that ain't had someone on they own
Hang on the words, you each have your song
Grab on and hold on, won't steer you wrong
Sing along, sing along, hmm

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I put A$AP on my tat (woo)
I put New York on the map (woo)
I put the gang on the flames (woo)
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains (woo)
I got Goyard by the sack (woo)
I got the boof by the pack (woo)
I fucked your boo on her back (woo)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
(Game, game, game, game)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Khloe Anna]
Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow (Gang, gang)
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now

[Outro: Khloe Anna & Moby]
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you (then and now)
I never meant to lie
