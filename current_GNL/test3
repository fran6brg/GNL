[Intro: A$AP Rocky + Juicy J]
Yeah, yeah I'm, y'all know what it is
Yeah I'm, yeah I'm, (shut the fuck up) yeah I'm, yeah I'm, yeah I'm
Yeah I'm

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, yeah, these niggas fake
No, we can't relate
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, this is how we live
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches (you know it)
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, yeah, these niggas fake
No, we can't relate (we do it)
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib

This is how it is, this is how we live
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
Yeah, I'm gettin' cake, yeah, it's no debate
Yeah, I fornicate with foreign hoes that I date, like, every day
Yeah, I rock the Raf, yeah, I bought the Wraith
Yeah, I'm out of state, yeah, I like to race
Yeah I'm, yeah I'm, yeah I'm, yeah I'm, yeah (you know it)
I wake up late, yeah, I'm out of shape, yeah, I'm eatin' crêpes
Yeah, I'm sippin' wine, yeah, she feed me grapes (grapes)
She make no mistakes, me make no complaints
I love how she think she graduated with that brain
She go to…

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib

Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, this is how we live
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches (shut the fuck up)

[Verse 2: A$AP Nast]
Tool on my waist, shades on my face
Money in the bank, make no mistake
Nast does it great
Yeah, hoes wanna fuck, car parked out front
7:45 on the fuckin' dot, your bitch down to ride
Leavin' wit' me 'cause I'm a G
Made in the streets, rep for the streets
So I keep a piece
Niggas try to front, act if he want
Act like he tough, end up in a box layin' on the side

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, yeah, these niggas fake
No, we can't relate
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, this is how we live
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches (bitches)
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, yeah, these niggas fake
No, we can't relate
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, this is how we live
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches

[Verse 3: A$AP Ant]
My mama told me, "Save that money—bank accounts—don't spend that bread."
Cash out on new necklaces, 14 karat bracelet
Dibble dabble with the lean
Hi-Tech with the cream soda
As I whipped the yola
Lambo red, Coca Cola
My bros, Cosa Nostra
Ridin' on a speedboat
She suckin', lickin', deep-throat
Rey Mysterio
When I'm jumpin' off the top rope
Banana clip with the scope
Wearin' all white
Like I'm the mothafuckin' pope

[Verse 4: A$AP Ferg]
I'm on a Yamborghini high, flyin' high through the sky, hey yo
Yammy's vision got us rich, catch a nigga flyin' by in a Lambo
Sippin' the Henny got me gone, now I'm gettin' in my zone, hey yo
R.I.P. to my nigga, the gallon goin' to my dome, hey yo
This how it feel to be rich, fuckin' bitches in the mix, yeah
Where the chiquitas is at? Yamborghini with the shits, yeah
Lil Newport lit, Young Lord with the shits, yeah
I ain't with the game, bitch, she blow my cartridge, yeah
My Jewelry glistening why I’m always chilly
Can't believe a nigga made a couple milli'
'Bout to cop the house way up in the hillies
With a bad bitch in the Bentley
Wood grain with the roof gone
Make a bitch fold like a futon
Gettin' bread like a crouton
Tell me what the fuck is you on

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, yeah, these niggas fake
No, we can't relate (you know it)
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, this is how we live
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, yeah, these niggas fake (ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy)
No, we can't relate
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib


This is how it is, this is how we live
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches
